It is very much a work in progress. Remote Cabin is a settlement just north of Vault 111. Exit vault, turn around, walk north. The settlement is very basic and currently has a copy of the components chest from the cheat room for testing purposes. There are seeds to get a farm started.\r\n\r\nThe goal for this mod was as a learning project to get me up to speed on the Creation Kit and to see if it was possible to make new, custom settlements intended for console, using only the built-in game objects and scripts.\r\n\r\nMost of the original references have been duplicated, moved underground and the copies made workshopable. The navmesh was updated and linked to all the converted items. Note that the door is chained and there is a an alternative way to enter the cabin. This \"puzzle\" was initially to force the cell to reload to ensure the settlement was properly loaded into the workshops array but this may not actually be necessary. However, I thought the puzzle was simple enough to leave in so it remains.\r\n\r\nAlso note that there is no \"build area graphic\" because I found that feature in the vanilla settlements to be unnecessary and frankly, somewhat lore breaking. Also they are custom, so if we want one on the console, we basically have to copy the Boston Airport one and it is flat and square and seems to look strange on hilly terrain. However, if there is demand, I can add a settlement border and may experiment with other available models from the game.\r\n\r\nAnd finally, the current available build-space is really only designed for maybe 6 settlers at most. If this project seems successful, I have plans to expand the build area, duplicate the foliage there and convert it into workshopable items but for now, there's just this half-cell for testing purposes.",
